## 1. 🎯 Project Overview (Context)

**Business Problem:**
The company experienced a -6% QoQ decline in total sales revenue in Q4, accompanied by a severe 58% drop in new opportunities. While Q4 is historically a slow season for the B2B Tech & Software sectors due to budget closures, the management needs to understand the root causes beyond seasonality.

**Objective:**
This project aims to move beyond descriptive analytics (what happened) to prescriptive analytics (what should we do). By diagnosing performance across Sectors, Sales Managers, and Product Lines, the goal is to provide actionable strategic recommendations to arrest the revenue decline and optimize the sales pipeline for the upcoming quarter.

## 2. 🗂️ Dataset

* **Source:** Maven Analytics (B2B CRM Sales Challenge Dataset).
* **Domain:** B2B Sales, CRM Data.
* **Key Metrics Tracked:** Total Sales Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), Total Orders, Conversion Rate (CVR), Average Weeks to Close, New Opportunities.

# I. Executive Summary

## 1. Overall health
Q4 witnessed a slight decline in the sales revenue, (-6% QoQ).
Consequently, The AOV and Total orders in Q4 also showed a negative growth.
Most notably, the new opportunities decreased significantly by nearly 58% compared to Q3.
While concerning, this aligns with historical trends as Q4 is typically a low-demand season for the B2B mobile phone industry, specificlly in Technology and Software sectors due to end-of-year budget closures.

## 2. Sector & Account Overview
Regarding the top 5 key sectors, the two main segments Software and Technology experienced a significant seasonal downturn, dropping by 7% and 9% respectively.
This decline directly impacted key accounts with Kancode(Software) falling by 31% and Konex (Technology) by 23%.
Although characteristic of the low season, the company should find out the root causes to prevent losing market share to competitors.

## 3. Team & Product Overview
An analysis of manager performance reveals that the revenue of Melvin Marxen, Rocco Neubert, Celia Rouche have decreased by 12% so I will deep dive in their performance later to identify potential problems.
Besides that, Sewald and Brinkmann had a good performance with 8% and 11% increase, respectively.
The products GTX Pro, GTX plus Basic and MG special also show significant drop by around 15% in sale.
The market research team should also check for any shifts in customer preferences.

**Key Actions:**
* **Retention:** Initiate urgent meetings with Kan-code and Konex to address their declining volume and secure commitments for Q1.
* **Expansion:** Engage Xx-holding to strategize on sustaining their growth and explore up-selling opportunities.
* **Knowledge Sharing:** Analyze the sales strategies of Brinkmann and Sewald to understand how they succeeded in a low season and apply these "best practices" to the rest of the team (especially for Melvin and Rocco).
* **Customer testing:** Verify potential shift in customer taste.


# II. Team Assessment

<img width="975" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c216f064-4341-44e7-9bcd-b1d7f7dd5087" />


Matrix assessment include two main metrics (Conversion rate, Average Sale) to measure the effectiveness of Managers.
Based on this model, we can classify Sales Managers into 4 main categories:
* G1: Celia Rouche
* G2: Dustin + Summer Sewald
* G3: Rocco Neubert + Melvin Marxen
* G4: Cara Losch

**Team Celia Rouche:** occupies the most balanced position—combining a high Conversion Rate (61.7%) with a strong Average Sale Value ($2,403).
She sells high-value items without sacrificing win rates.
The Growth Paradox: Despite these excellent efficiency metrics, her total revenue plummeted by -12.29% QoQ.
Root Cause: The decline is driven by Low Volume.
She only closed 179 deals (significantly lower than the market leaders at ~250 deals).

**Action:** Celia does not need training; she needs more opportunities. Shift incoming leads from low-performing teams (e.g., Rocco Neubert, who wastes 42% of leads) to Celia Rouche. Analyze her sales workflow to understand how she closes deals in just 6.43 weeks. Document her closing techniques to train slower teams like Dustin (6.99 weeks).

**Team Dustin:** is the growth champion of the quarter, delivering an impressive +11.05% QoQ increase while the company average declined.
However, there is a significant efficiency gap: despite a strong Conversion Rate (63.2%), the team records the lowest Average Sale Value ($1,488) and the longest sales cycle (6.99 weeks).
This suggests the team is working harder, not smarter—spending too much time closing small, low-margin deals.

**Action:** Shift focus from Volume to Value. Implement Upselling training and set a target Avg. Sale of $2,000 for next quarter.

**Team Sewald:** Summer Sewald is the top-performing manager, maintaining both positive growth (+7.88%) and the company's highest Conversion Rate (64.7%).
This team represents the ideal balance of efficiency and revenue.
**Action:** Leverage Sewald as a Mentor. Arrange shadowing sessions for struggling teams (like Rocco’s) to learn from Sewald’s closing techniques. Coordinate with HR to backfill Carlin's position immediately.

**Team Rocco Neubert:** Rocco achieves the highest Average Sale in the company ($2,935), proving his ability to close premium deals and upsell effectively.
However, his Conversion Rate is poor (57.8%), falling below the company average (60.3%).
Impact: This inefficiency has led to a significant revenue drop of -12.78% QoQ.
He is landing big fish but letting too many swim away.
**Actions:**
* **Conversion Coaching:** Rocco does not need product training (his Avg. Sale proves he knows the value). He needs Objection Handling training to stop losing 42% of his leads.
* **Lead Filtering:** Since he excels at high-value deals, consider assigning him only Enterprise/Premium leads, while routing smaller/transactional leads to Dustin or Cara.
* **Metrics Monitor:** Set a KPI to improve CVR to 60% next quarter. If he maintains his $2,935 avg. sale with a 60% win rate, his revenue will recover immediately.

**Team Melvin Marxen: (High Speed, High Waste):** Melvin is the current top 1 Revenue Generator ($670,788), carrying the bulk of the company's performance.
He closes deals in just 6.25 weeks, the fastest rate in the team.
Critical Risk: His speed comes at a cost. He has the lowest Conversion Rate (55.6%) among active managers.
The -12.63% QoQ decline suggests this "burn and turn" strategy is no longer sustainable in a shrinking market.
He is burning through leads too quickly without nurturing them.
**Actions:**
* **Conversion rate is key:** Melvin needs to prioritize Quality over Speed. Instruct him to spend more time nurturing hesitant clients rather than discarding them to find the next easy win.
* **Retention Strategy:** Analyze his lost deals. If he is losing customers because he is rushing the negotiation, implement a mandatory "Deal Review" step for opportunities >$3,000.
* **Peer Learning:** Pair him with Summer Sewald (High CVR). Melvin teaches Summer how to speed up; Summer teaches Melvin how to nurture relationships.

**Team Cara Losch, the (Low Volume, Avg. Metrics):** Cara shows no distinctive strengths.
Her Avg. Sale ($2,271) and Weeks to Close (6.69) are average.
She has the lowest revenue ($311,148) among full-time managers (excluding the outlier Dustin who is growing, and Carlin who left).
She only closed 137 deals, which is almost half the volume of top performers like Summer or Melvin.
**Actions:**
* **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP):** Cara is currently "drifting." She needs a clear identity. Option A: Increase Volume. Aim for 180 deals next quarter. Option B: Increase Value. Aim for $2,500 Avg. Sale.
* **Activity Audit:** Why is her volume so low (137 sales)? Is she lacking leads, or is her prospecting effort insufficient? Review her daily activity logs (calls/emails).
* **Shadowing:** Require her to shadow Celia Rouche. Both have lower volumes, but Celia is much more efficient and effective. Cara needs to learn how to maximize every opportunity she gets.

## Key takeaways

**1. Protect the Core (Stability & Scale)**
* **Focus:** Summer Sewald & Celia Rouche
* **Rationale:** These are the most consistent and balanced performers. They represent the "safe zone" of the business.
* **Action:** Maintain their current momentum and allocate additional resources (leads/budget) to help them scale up without compromising their high efficiency.

**2. Fix the Leak (Optimization)**
* **Focus:** Rocco Neubert & Melvin Marxen
* **Rationale:** These are the top revenue generators but they suffer from high wastage (low Conversion Rates).
* **Action:** Implement strict Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) measures to stop losing valuable leads. A small increase in their win rate will yield the highest revenue recovery for the company.

**3. Drive Efficiency (Value & Volume)**
* **Focus:** Dustin Brinkmann & Cara Losch
* **Rationale:**
    * **Dustin:** High volume but low value. Action: Pivot focus to Upselling and higher average ticket size.
    * **Cara:** Average metrics but low activity. Action: Increase Sales Activity/Volume (calls, meetings, proposals) to match the team average


# III. Product Assessment

<img width="975" height="608" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8120f7cb-62df-4432-ad78-aa34b3d24be9" />


Based on the Pareto principle, the data clearly shows that GTX Pro, GTX Plus Pro, and MG Advanced are the top 3 key revenue drivers, contributing to more than 80% of the total income.
As a result, even a small variation in these 3 products can significantly impact the overall revenue, that what this analysis sorely focuses on the performance of them.

**GTX Pro** remain the top revenue contributor but is the key primary driver of company’s downturn with a significant – 12.59% drop.
Despite revenue decline, it maintains a healthy conversion rate and high Average order value
* **Key insight:** The product is not losing competitiveness (CVR is still high), but it is losing momentum. The sharp decline suggests a potential Cannibalization Effect where customers may be migrating to the new GTX plus pro or the sale team is neglecting this core product to chase premium deals.
* **Action Plan:** Since the Conversion Rate is high, the issue is strictly Volume. Increase top-of-funnel marketing specifically for this SKU to arrest the decline and restore the revenue baseline.

**GTX Plus Pro** ranks 2nd in revenue ($795K) and is the only product in top 3 to record positive growth (2.57%).
This is the most valuable product, boasting the highest metrics across the board: highest conversion rate and highest price point
* **Insight:** The data proves that customers currently prefer the Premium option over the Standard one. The fact that the most expensive product is the easiest to sell (Highest CVR) indicates a very strong product-market fit. However, a +2.57% growth rate is underwhelming for such a high-performing SKU. It should be scaling much faster.
* **Action Plan:**
    * **Aggressive Upsell:** Mandate sales teams to lead with GTX Plus Pro as the default option in all pitch decks.
    * **Resource Allocation:** Shift the majority of the marketing budget to this SKU. It has the best margin and conversion; the goal is to drive double-digit growth next quarter.

**MG Advanced:** Revenue remains virtually flat with a slight dip of -0.94%.
Positioned at a mid-range price point (~$2,000) but suffers from a lower Conversion Rate (57.9%) compared to the more expensive GTX series.
* **Insight:** This product is suffering from being stuck in the Middle. It is cheaper than the GTX series but harder to sell. Customers likely perceive it as not good enough compared to the Pro versions, yet too expensive to be a budget option. It fails to compel the buyer, resulting in wasted sales effort.
* **Action Plan:**
    * **Repositioning:** Either upgrade its features to match the GTX series or lower the price to compete in the volume segment.
    * **Bundle Strategy:** Stop selling it as a standalone Hero product. Use it in bundles or as a cross-sell option to clear inventory and improve overall deal value.
